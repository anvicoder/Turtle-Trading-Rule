# Turtle-Trading-Rule
# Turtle Trading EDA Model
Step 1: Read the Turtle Trading Research Paper <br>
Step 2: Downloaded the data in the local device and upload it on Google colab<br>
Step 3: Uploaded the data in the data frame using Pandas Library to perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)<br>
Step 4: Calculating and removing the missing Values and exploring the datatype of each column<br>
Step 5: Since the concerning data is closing data in Turtle Tradig and it is continuous so I had performed Linear regression it calculating the mean square error and did training and testing <br>
Step 6: Plotting the graph for the datetime as x-axis and closing and opening at y-axis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Turtle Trading Rule in Google Colab

## Overview
This repository contains a Colab notebook for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical price data using the Turtle Trading Rule strategy. The analysis is conducted using Google Colab, a free cloud-based platform for executing Python code.

## Contents
- `Turtle Trading Rule.ipynb`: Colab notebook containing the code and analysis for EDA on Turtle Trading Rule.

## Getting Started
To run the notebook, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Upload your historical price data (in CSV format) to Google Colab or mount your Google Drive to access the data.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform EDA on the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis should contain historical price data for the asset(s) you want to analyze using the Turtle Trading Rule strategy. The dataset should include columns such as 'datetime', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', etc.

## Analysis
The notebook guides you through the following steps of EDA:
- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Preprocessing the data (handling missing values, converting data types, etc.).
- Applying the Turtle Trading Rule strategy to generate buy and sell signals.
- Visualizing the price data along with the buy and sell signals.
